This technique of summarization attempts to identify key sentences in a provided text and returns a summary that is the result of returning just those key sentences.\n\nThe process we will follow to summarize text is a subset of the text analytics pipeline that includes these steps:\n\n- Normalize the text: in this case, simply to clean the text of line break characters. This followed by some simple sentence tokenization, which breaks the paragraph into sentences and removes any extra trailing spaces. Finally the cleaned up text is returned as string.\n- Apply the analytic method: in this case, we use the summarize method provided by the gensim library to generate the summarized result."
