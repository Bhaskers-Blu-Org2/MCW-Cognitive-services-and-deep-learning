## Requirements

1.  Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN

    a.  Trial subscriptions will not work. You will run into issues with Azure resource quota limits.

    b.  Subscriptions with access limited to a single resource group will not work. You will need the ability to deploy multiple resource groups.

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 30 minutes

To maximize your lab time, the following steps which setup your environment should be performed before attending the lab.

#### Task 1: Provision the Windows Virtual Machine

1.  Navigate to the Azure Portal at <https://portal.azure.com>

2.  Select **Create a resource**

    ![Screenshot of the Create a resource button.](images/Setup/image3.png "Create a resource button")

3.  Select **Compute** and then select **Windows Server 2016 Datacenter**

    ![In the New blade, Compute is selected.](images/Setup/image4.png "New blade")

4.  On the **Basics** blade provide the following inputs:

    a.  **Name**: enter labvm

    b.  **VM disk type**: select HDD. This will enable you to use a GPU based machine if you choose to in the subsequent step.

    c.  **User name**: enter demouser

    d.  **Password and Confirm Password:** enter Abc!1234567890

    e.  **Subscription**: select your Azure subscription

    f.  **Resource group**: select Create new and provide the name mcw-ai-lab

    g.  **Location**: select either South Central US or East US (or any of the regions in which the NC-series VM's are currently available, see the [regions service page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/) for an up to date listing).

    ![The Basics blade fields are set to the previously defined settings.](images/Setup/image5.png "Basics blade")

7.  Within a few moments, you should see the desktop for your new Data Science Virtual Machine

#### Task 3: Initialize Azure Machine Learning Workbench

Before using the Azure Machine Learning Workbench on the VM, you will need to take the one-time action of AzureML Workbench Setup to install your instance of the workbench. 

1.  Within the RDP session to the VM, open Server Manager

2.  Select Local server

    ![Screenshot showing selecting Local Server within Server Manager.](images/Setup/image14.png "Server Manager")

3.  In the Properties area, look for IE Enhanced Security Configuration and select On

4.  In the dialog, set both options to Off and select OK

    ![Screenshot showing the Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration dialog box with the Administrators and Users options both set to off.](images/Setup/image19.png "Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration dialog box")

5. Using Internet Explorer on the VM, download the Azure Machine Learning Workbench from:
https://aka.ms/azureml-wb-msi 

6. At the prompt, choose Save and when finished downloading choose Run

7.  Step through all the prompts leaving all values at their defaults to complete the Workbench installation. Installation will take about 25 minutes. Use the **X** to close the install when it is finished.

    ![The Azure Machine Learning Workbench Installer screen displays the message, Installation successful.](images/Setup/image17.png "Azure Machine Learning Workbench Installer screen")

8. Next, download Visual Studio Code from the following location:
https://code.visualstudio.com/download 

9. Select to download the Windows version:\
    ![Screenshot showing the download tile for the Windows version of Visual Studio Code](images/Setup/image20.png "Download the Windows version")
    
10. Save the download and Run it when completed

11. Step thru the Visual Studio Code installation, leaving all values at their defaults


#### Task 4: Stop the Lab VM

If you are performing this setup the night before the hands-on lab, you can optionally Stop the VM to save on costs overnight, and resume it when you are ready to start on the lab. Follow these steps to Stop the VM:

1.  Return to the Azure Portal

2.  Navigate to the blade of your labvm

3.  Select the **Stop** button

    ![Screenshot of the Stop button.](images/Setup/image18.png "Stop button")

> **NOTE:** When you are ready to resume the VM, simply follow the previous steps and instead of selecting Stop, select **Start**. You VM will take about 5 minutes to start up, after which you can use the **Connect** button in the VM blade to RDP into the VM as before.

You should follow all steps provided *before* attending the hands-on lab.
