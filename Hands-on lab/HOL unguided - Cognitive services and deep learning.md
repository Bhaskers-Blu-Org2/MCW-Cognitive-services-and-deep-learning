# Cognitive Services and deep learning hands-on lab unguided 

## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this hands-on lab, you will implement and deploy a monitoring a web application to Azure IaaS. Azure security and management services will be used to manage and monitor the operational performance and security of the underlying infrastructure. Azure Application Insights will be used to monitor performance, application usage, and identify the cause of any application issues that emerge.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to implement solutions leveraging Azure Machine Learning services and Cognitive Services.

## Overview

In this workshop you will help Contoso Ltd. Build a proof of concept that shows how they could build a solution that amplifies the claims processing capabilities of their agents.

## Solution architecture

The high-level architecture of the solution is illustrated in the diagram. The lab is performed within the context of a Jupyter Notebook running within a VM on Azure. Various notebooks are built to test the integration with the Cognitive Services listed, to train customer ML services, and to integrate the results in a simple user interface that shows the result of processing the claim with all of the AI services involved.

![The High-level architectural solution begins with a Claim, which points to Jupyter notebook. Jupyter then points to Computer Vision, Text Analytics, and Containerized Services, which includes a Classification Service and a Summary Service that both process claim text.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-CognitiveServicesanddeeplearningimages/media/image2.png "High-level architectural solution")

3.  Test the deployed service with the following command (modify the parameter values to suit your actual deployment):

    az ml service run realtime -i summarizer.**\[mcwailab-xyz.location\]** -d \"I was driving down El Camino and stopped at a red light. It was about 3pm in the afternoon. The sun was bright and shining just behind the stoplight. This made it hard to see the lights. There was a car on my left in the left turn lane. A few moments later another car, a black sedan pulled up behind me. When the left turn light changed green, the black sedan hit me thinking that the light had changed for us, but I had not moved because the light was still red. After hitting my car, the black sedan backed up and then sped past me. I did manage to catch its license plate. The license plate of the black sedan was ABC123."

4.  Verify you get a summary back

5.  In a notepad or other location take note of the full Service ID (e.g., summarizer.mcwailab-xyz.location) and the authorization key, which you will need later in the lab. To get the authorization key for your deployed service, run the following command and take note of the PrimaryKey value in the output:

    ```
    az ml service keys realtime -i summarizer.[mcwailab-xyz.location]
    ```

#### Exit criteria

## After the hands-on lab 

Duration: 5 minutes

To avoid unexpected charges, it is recommended that you clean up all of your lab resources when you complete the lab.

### Task 1: Clean up lab resources

1.  Navigate to the Azure Portal and locate the Resource Groups you created for this lab

    a.  mcw-ai-lab

    b.  mcwailabenv (note there are two resources groups starting with this name, so delete both)

2.  Select **Delete resource group** from the command bar

    ![Screenshot of the Delete resource group button.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-CognitiveServicesanddeeplearningimages/media/image24.png "Delete resource group button")

3.  In the confirmation dialog that appears, enter the name of the resource group and select **Delete**

4.  Wait for the confirmation that the Resource Group has been successfully deleted. If you don't wait, and the delete fails for some reason, you may be left with resources running that were not expected. You can monitor using the Notifications dialog, accessible from the Alarm icon.

    ![The Notifications dialog box has a message stating that the resource group is being deleted.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-CognitiveServicesanddeeplearningimages/media/image25.png "Notifications dialog box")
