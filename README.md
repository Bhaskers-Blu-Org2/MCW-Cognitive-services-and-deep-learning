# Cognitive services and deep learning

In this workshop, you will help Contoso Ltd. build a proof of concept that shows how they can build a solution that amplifies the claims processing capabilities of their agents.

## Target audience

- AI developer
- Data scientist

## Abstract

### Workshop

In this workshop, you will learn to combine both pre-built artificial intelligence (AI) (in the form of various Cognitive Services) with custom AI (in the form of services built and deployed with Azure Machine Learning services). You will learn to create intelligent solutions atop unstructured text data by designing and implementing a text analytics pipeline. You will also learn how to build a binary classifier using a simple neural network that can be used to classify the textual data. Also, you will learn how to deploy multiple kinds of predictive services using Azure Machine Learning and learn to integrate with the Computer Vision API and the Text Analytics API from Cognitive Services.

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to present solutions leveraging Azure Machine Learning services and Cognitive Services.

### Whiteboard design session

In this whiteboard design session, you will work with a group to design a solution which combines both pre-built artificial intelligence (AI) (in the form of various Cognitive Services) with custom AI (in the form of services built and deployed with Azure Machine Learning services). You will learn to create intelligent solutions atop unstructured text data by designing and implementing a text analytics pipeline. You will also learn how to build a binary classifier using a simple neural network that can be used to classify the textual data. Also, you will learn how to deploy multiple kinds of predictive services using Azure Machine Learning and learn to integrate with the Computer Vision API and the Text Analytics API from Cognitive Services.

At the end of this whiteboard design session, you will be better able to design solutions leveraging Azure Machine Learning services and Cognitive Services.

### Hands-on lab

In this hands-on lab, you will implement a solution which combines both pre-built artificial intelligence (AI) (in the form of various Cognitive Services) with custom AI (in the form of services built and deployed with Azure Machine Learning services). You will learn to create intelligent solutions atop unstructured text data by designing and implementing a text analytics pipeline. You will also learn how to build a binary classifier using a simple neural network that can be used to classify the textual data. Also, you will learn how to deploy multiple kinds of predictive services using Azure Machine Learning and learn to integrate with the Computer Vision API and the Text Analytics API from Cognitive Services.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to implement solutions leveraging Azure Machine Learning services and Cognitive Services.
